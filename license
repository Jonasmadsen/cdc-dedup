This license intends to absolve me of all responsibility for your usage of this code. 
I created this code and provide it freely for you to examine and use in projects you see fit. 
I donâ€™t provide any support or warranty or guarantee. 
This may and may not work for you now or in the future, please don't annoy me, but do contact me about issues so that I may correct them in my time.
I guess this license should be compatible with a few other open source licenses, i'm not sure, you can figure it out im sure.
